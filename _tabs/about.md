**Hey! My name is Syed Ahkam** (you can call me Syed). I'm 17 years old as of now. My pronouns are He/Him.

Since my childhood, I have been interested in a number of things. From mobile phones to cooking, from programming to gardening, from breaking down my toys to fixing other people's technical issues.

People call me a tech guru, quiet guy, nerd, the guy who sucks at studies, a serious person, etcetera.

On my technical side, I tend to be interested in softwares more than hardware. Maybe it's just because hardware is not as readily available as software is. Like for example, if you were interested in a new application, you could just download it from their website or package manager; Most of my technical knowledge at the moment comes from my programming skills: I consider myself proficient in Python, 'good' in JavaScript, okayish in C/C++, Rust and Java. Presently, I've been trying to learn low-level concepts behind high-level languages by learning some low-level languages: You know, concepts like memory management, differences between stack and heap, threading, and learning to live without OOP.

On my cooking side, I occasionally help my mother in the kitchen, learn new recipes online then attempt to cook it, then learning i messed up, hoping to fix next time. The philosophy behind my personal cooking is: "just add in whatever you think will improve its taste".

Gardening is actually in my bloodstream, inherited by my parents who in turn had it inherited by their parents, and so on. I can't say that I'm as passionate gardener as my parents but my interests are perceptive to further increase.

Feel free to contact me at one of the social links in sidebar if you'd like.
