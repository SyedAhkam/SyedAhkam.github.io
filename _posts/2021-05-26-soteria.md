Soteria is a next-gen verification bot utilising the power of captchas.

Or, Simply-- Soteria is a discord-bot for verifying newbies.

## How It works

Whenever a new member joins your server:

- Soteria fetches the [verification method](#verification-methods) for your server.
- Acts according to the verification method set:
    * DM: Starts [DM verification](#dm)
    * CHANNEL: Starts [Channel verification](#channel)
    * REACTION: Starts [Reaction verification](#reaction)
- Gives the user [verified-role](#configuration) upon successful attempt.

> If they fail to verify in first attempt, `s!verify` command could be used to restart process.

## Motto

We love minimalism and are against bloated codebases. ie. Soteria does all that you expect from a 'verification bot'-- Nothing more or less.

## Features

Soteria has many features however we try not to over-complicate it.

### High quality captchas

Soteria uses high-quality text based captchas. Could be a little cumbersome at times-- But good for taking care of bad guys.

### Good Uptime

If I say "Good Uptime", I mean it. Unless my server breaks down.

### Minimal commands

Do you not hate when a bot has 200+ commands? And you have no idea what command to use.

### Highly customizable yet easy to use

We made Soteria highly-customizable yet still keeping it easy to use.

Soteria automatically uses defaults for many config values so you don't have to mess with them if not required.

### Will always keep getting better

No, We won't be forgetting about this bot in the future-- We'll keep improving it!

## Verification Methods

Soteria supports many verification methods. It defaults to DM.

> More about it in [configuration](#configuration) section.

### DM

DM's a user on join. As easy as that.

This is the default method-- so just set verified role and forget about it.

### Channel

Same as [DM](#dm) in functionality-- However, Starts verification process in a configured verification channel of a server.

### Reaction

Verifies the user using a simple reaction to, a pre-configured reaction message inside a reaction channel.

This by-far requires the most config values yet it's the most insecure method.

Reaction emoji could be set as both unicode and custom emoji.

## Back Story

Soteria bot started as a challenge between two friends-- Syed and Распутин to be exact.
The challenge was: "One of us would code in Python and other in JS, And later we would judge each other's end-result" (no hate on languages)

Unfortunately, Распутин's busy life did not allow him to pursue the afforementioned challenge-- Hence, The bot in production currently is the one coded by Syed.

## Current State

Currently, I'm keeping an eye out for any bugs-- If you find any, Please report to us.

As far as guilds are concerned, Soteria has surpassed **10** guilds as of now. Thanks to everyone who invited soteria to their server.

## Future Plans

I will keep improving the bot. And waiting for that golden day I'll recieve a developer badge.

## Thanks

I'd like to thank Распутин#0926 for his amazing captcha API. This project wouldn't have been possible without it.
