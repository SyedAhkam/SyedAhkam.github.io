## Introduction

This could easily be one of the most asked question in the tech space— "How to learn to code?".
Everyone's got their own different *methods* and *techniques*.

Now you probably are thinking— _Why am I so special then?_ Well, I am not. I am here to write about my opinions, And, *How I learned to code*. You don't need to follow my footsteps if you don't want to.

## Programming Language

Doesn't matter whom you ask; You would always recieve a biased opinion about this.

To choose your first programming language. Ask yourself these questions:

### What exactly do you want to do?
Do you want to do web-development? Do you want to work on low-level applications? Or perhaps you want to do mobile development? 
    
* Web
:   If you are interested in web-development. No matter what, you can't escape from JavaScript.

* Desktop Software
:   This area of programming is pretty broad and very permissive in your choice of programming language. From Python to C/C++

* Mobile
:   If interested in Android, You can't escape Java or Java's new cousin Kotlin.
:   If interested in IOS, You need to learn Swift or Objective C.
:   If interested in Hybrid Apps, It could be done in almost any language (assuming a framework for it exists)

* Game
:   It's mostly all done in C# nowadays (thanks to unity). But if you care about performance, It might be better to choose something like C++ instead.

* Low Level
:   You would need a *low-level* language ofcourse like C/C++. Recently there's emerging a new promising language called Rust.

Make sure to choose the right language for your task or you may end up using python for low-level and even worse C for web-dev.

### What do you prefer? Simplicity or Speed?
Depending upon your choice: You may have to make some trade-offs. For example, You may choose Python but it doesn't focus on speed. Likewise, C/C++ is fast however not simple.

Want to see some code?
```py
    print("Hello World!")
```
*Hello World program in Python*

```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("Hello World!");
        return 0;
    }
```
*Hello World program in C*

If you love simplicity, then you might find C to be a little cumbersome and verbose. Eventhough it's much faster than python.
